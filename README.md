# OFDM-Simulation
OFDM Simulation in MATLAB for Teleco students

The main scripts are:
simulation.m
simulation_BER_curves.m
simulation DFTs.m

In these scripts you can change the parameters and choose the channel before running the script.

The rest of the files are needed because are the functions that the main scrpts will use to process the parameters.
